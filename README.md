# Supercomputer
Implemented Topological Sort algorithm to manage multiple datasets efficiently.
Split the main queue into two queues, applying the algorithm alternately until both are emptied.
Increment context switches for each new dataset.

# Railway Tracks
Utilized Tarjan's algorithm to identify strongly connected components.
For single-node components, checked reachability and added paths if necessary.
For multi-node components, checked for external nodes with paths to any component node, determining the number of paths to add.
